# Hold scan button
This mod allows you to hold the scan button to continuously keep scanning instead of having to spam the button.

## Installation guide

Install this like any other BepInEx mod, either manually of with r2modman / Thunderstore.

When installing manually, install the mod in the following directory:
```
\GAME_LOCATION\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins
```

This mod is completely client side, so no one else needs to install it besides the client for it to work.

## Compatibility

This mod should be now fully compatible with all the other scan mods out there. I want to give a big shoutout to **NikolaTeslaX**, who contacted me with a solution for the compatibility problem that the previous versions of this mod had, he did all the work for this one.

## FAQ

### I found a bug / compatibility issue, where can I report this?

You can create an issue on my GitHub page linked at the very top, go to the #mod-releases forum on the community discord server (https://discord.gg/lethal-company), or just DM me on Discord (nickname: futuresavior).

Again, BIG thank you to NikolaTeslaX for solving the compatibility issue. Also thank you to Lunxara and Robyn for updating the mod so it's up to the latest standard.
