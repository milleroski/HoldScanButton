# Hold scan button
This is a reupload of Hold Scan Button originally developed by FutureSavior, the original mod was deprecated and I wanted people to still be able to access it.

## Installation guide

Install this like any other BepInEx mod, either manually or with Gale / R2/Thunderstore Mod Manager.

When installing manually, install the mod in the following directory:
```
\GAME_LOCATION\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins
```

This mod is completely client side, so no one else needs to install it besides the client for it to work.

## Compatibility

This mod should be fully compatible with all the other scan mods out there and never break, if it does I won't provide support or update the mod as I'm not the original maintainer. You can find the original Github here. https://github.com/milleroski/HoldScanButton

## Credits
All credits go to FutureSavior for originally making the mod ^^
